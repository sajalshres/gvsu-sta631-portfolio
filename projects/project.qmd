## Introduction

![](../assets/app.gif)

This project aims to create a recommendation engine for online streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Videos, Netflix, Disney, and Hulu. The goal is to understand how these platforms generate recommendations and implement a recommendation engine. Accurate recommendations for movies or series are crucial for a platform's success.

To achieve this, a linear regression analysis will be performed to build a model and generate predictions. Various regression models will also be explored and their performance will be compared.

**Note**: I encountered problems while deploying my application to **shinyapps.io** due to the large data size. Because of time constraints, I decided to host it on my small Linux box with an Intel Core i5 6500T processor and 4 GB of RAM. If you are experiencing similar issues, please contact me at **shressaj\@mail.gvsu.edu**. Alternatively, you can run it locally by following the setup instructions in the project's **README.md**.
