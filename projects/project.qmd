## Introduction

This project aims to create a recommendation engine for online streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Videos, Netflix, Disney, and Hulu. The goal is to understand how these platforms generate recommendations and implement a recommendation engine. Accurate recommendations for movies or series are crucial for a platform's success.

To achieve this, a linear regression analysis will be performed to build a model and generate predictions. Various regression models will also be explored and their performance will be compared.
